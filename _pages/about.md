I’m a **Mechanical Engineering undergraduate** at **Chung-Ang University** in **Seoul, South Korea**, pursuing hands-on robotics development that bridges **mechanical design**, **control**, and **intelligent perception**.

My primary interests include:
- **Robotics** and mechatronic system design  
- **Autonomous systems** and real-world deployment  
- **Control** (model-based and data-driven)  
- **Embedded systems** and sensor integration  
- **Computer vision** for monitoring and autonomy  

## Goal
I am preparing for **MS in Robotics in the US**, with a focus on building robust robotic systems through research and project-based experience.

## Contact
The best way to reach me is via email. You can also connect with me on LinkedIn using the icons below.
